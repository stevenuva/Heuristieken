##QUESTION A
Question A asked us if it was possible to load our four spaceships with 84 parcels or more.
Using the greedy algorithm in heurstiek_A.py it is possible to fit 82 parcels in the spacecrafts. For this you will need to load csv file cargolist1.

##QUESTION B
Question B asked us what the greatest amount of parcels is we can fit in our four spaceships and what it would cost taking fuel into consideration.
By running Heuristieken_B.py we found that we can fit 82 parcels. First we calculated the cheapest option by taking the same fuel-to-weight (FtW) ratio for every spaceship. One option hereby is $335,000 cheaper than the second option (Cygnus: 17, Progress: 15, Kounotori: 28, Dragon: 22). The only difference between the options is the shift of one cargeo between Cygnus and Progress. Making the first option the cheapest with $2.009.210.000. We are still working on the part where every spacecraft has his own FtW.
