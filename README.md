Structure:  
The folder "data" contains the cargolists with the csv files, which are necessaty to load the code. 
Heuristiek.py contains the main code for our greedy algorithm.
Spacecraft_classes.py contains our created classes.

QUESTION A
(Question a asked us if it was possible to load our four spaceships with 84 parcels or more).

Using the greedy algorithm and while running heurstiek_A.py it is possible to fit 82 parcels in the spacecrafts. For this you will need to load csv file cargolist1. There is no need for extra installations to run our code. 

QUESTION B
Run Heursitieken_B.py which can be found in the folder Opdracht B. If you run Opdracht_B.py you will find that you can 82 parcels with you. One option thereby is $335,000 cheaper than the second option (Cygnus: 17, Progress: 15, Kounotori: 28, Dragon: 22). The only difference between the options is the shift of one cargeo between Cygnus and Progress.
