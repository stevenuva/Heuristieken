The folder "presentations" contains our weekly presentations.  
The folder "data" contains the cargolists with the csv files, which has to be loaded into the code. 
Heuristiek.py contains the code for our greedy algorithm. 

QUESTION A
Question a asked us if it was possible to load our four spaceships with 84 parcels or more. Using our greedy algorithm in heurstiek.py we can fit 82 parcels in total in our spacecrafts. In this code we loaded the csv file cargolist1 and wrote in a list of dictionaries. For the moment there is no need for extra installations to run our code.
